    "\n",
    "You are likely to spend far more time than you think dredging through  your data manually, checking it, editing it, and reformatting it to  make it useful for the actual data exploration and statistical  analysis. For example, you may need to:  \n",
    "* Identify the variables vs observations within the data --- somebody else might have recorded the data, or you might have  collected the data some time back!\n",
    "* Fill in zeros (true measured/observed absences) \n",
    "* Identify and add a value (e.g., `-999999`) to denote missing observations\t\n",

    "\n",
    "So you would like to a record of the data wrangling process (so that it  is repeatable and even reversible), and automate it to the extent  possible. To this end, here are some guidelines:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Store data in universally-readable, nonproprietary software formats (e.g., `.csv`)\n",
    "* Use plain ASCII text for your file names, variable/field/column names, and data values --- make sure the \"text encoding\" is correct and standard  (e.g., `UTF-8`)\n",
    "* Keep a metadata file for each unique dataset (agian, in  non-proprietary format)\n",
    "* Don't (over-)modify your raw data by hand --- use scripts  instead --- keep a copy of the data as they were recorded.\n",
    "* Use meaningful names for your data and files and field (column) names\n",
    "* When you add data, try not to add columns (widening the format); rather, design your  tables/datasheets so that you add only rows (lengthening the format) --- and convert ``wide format data'' to ``long format data'' using  scripts, not by hand!\n",
    "* All cells within a data column should contain only one type of information (i.e., either text (character), numeric, etc.). \n",
    "* Ultimately, consider creating a relational database for your  data (see [below](#Databases-and-R)).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not an exhaustive list either --- read the [Borer et al (2009) paper](#Readings).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the Pound Hill dataset collected by students in a past Silwood Field Course week for understanding/illustrating some of these  principles. \n",
    "\n",
    "To start with, we need to import the {\\tt raw} data file, for which, follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Go to the repository and navigate to the `Data` directory. \n",
    "* Copy the file `PoundHillData.csv` and `PoundHillMetaData.csv` files into your own R week's `Data` directory. \n",

    "When the dataset is large (e.g., 1000’s of rows), cleaning and exploring it can get tricky, and you are very likely to make many mistakes.

You may need to specify the encoding in that case, using the `encoding` argument of `read.csv()` and ` read.table()`. You can check the encoding of a file by using `find` in Linux/Mac.

    "\n",
    "#### Convert wide format data to long format using scripts\n",
    "\n",
    "You typically record data in the field or experiments using a “wide” format, where a subject’s (e.g., habitat, plot, treatment, species etc) repeated responses or observations (e.g., species count, biomass, etc) will be in a single row, and each response in a separate column. The raw Pound Hill data were recorded in precisely this way. However, the wide format is not ideal for data analysis — instead you need the data in a “long” format, where each row is one observation point per subject. So each subject will have data in multiple rows. Any measures/variables/observations that don’t change across the subjects will have the same value in all the rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "For humans, the wide format is generally more intuitive for viewing and recording (e.g., in field data sheets) since one can actually view more of the data visually. However, the long format is more machine-readable and is closer to the formatting of databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can switch between wide and formats using `melt()` and `dcast()` from the `reshape2` package, as illustrated in `DataWrang.R`.\n",

    "### And then came dplyr and tidyr\n",
    "\n",

    "## Handling Big Data in R\n",
    "\n",
    "The buzzword ‘Big Data’ basically refers to datasets that have the following properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  A dataset that does not fit into available RAM on one system (say, >2 gigabytes).\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  A dataset that has so many rows (when in it’s long format — see above sections) that it significantly slows down your analysis or simulation without vectorization (that is, when looping).\n",
    "\n",
    "Both these criteria are programming language- and computer hardware-dependent, of course. For example, a 32-bit OS can only handle ~2 GB of RAM, so your computer screams “Big Data!” (slows down/hangs) every time you try to handle a dataset in that range.\n",
    "\n",
    "R reads data into RAM all at once when you using the `read.table` (or its wrapper, `read.csv()` — maybe\n",
    "you have realized by now that `read.csv()` is basically calling `read.table()` with a particular set of options. That is, objects in R live in memory entirely, and big-ish data in RAM will cause R to choke. Python has similar problems, but you can circumventthese to an extent by using `numpy` arrays (see the basic Python Chapter in [these notes](https://github.com/mhasoba/TheMulQuaBio/blob/master/silbiocomp/SilBioComp.pdf)).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few options (which you can combine, of course) if you are actually using datasets that are so large:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Import large files smartly; e.g., using `scan()` in R, and then create subsets of the data that you need. Also, use the `reshape` or `tidyr` package to covert your data in the most “square” (so neither too long or too wide) format as possible. Of course, you will need subsets of data in long format for analysis (see sections above).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use the `bigmemory` package to load data in the gb range (e.g., use `read.big.matrix()` instead of `read.table()`. This package also has other useful functions, such as `foreach()` instead of `for()` for better memory management.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use a 64 bit version of R with enough memory and preferably on Linux!\n",
    "\n",
    "* Vectorize your analyses/simulations to the extent possible (See Python and R chapters in [these notes](https://github.com/mhasoba/TheMulQuaBio/blob/master/silbiocomp/SilBioComp.pdf)).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use databases (more on this below).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use distributed computing (distribute the analysis/simulation across\n",
    "    multiple CPU’s).\n",
    "\n",
    "The next subsection superficially covers databases. We will cover memory management in the advanced Python, HPC and C weeks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Databases and R\n",
    "\n",
    "R can be used to link to and extract data from online databases such as PubMed and GenBank, or to manipulate and access your own. Computational Biology datasets are often quite large, and it makes sense to access their data by querying the databases instead of manually downloading them. So also, your own data may be complex and large, in which case you may want to organize and manage those data in a proper relational\n",
    "database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Practically all the data wrangling principles in the previous sections are a part and parcel of relational databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many R packages that provide an interface to databases (SQLite, MySQL, Oracle, etc). Check out R packages `DBI` (<http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/DBI/index.html>) and ` RMySQL` (<https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RMySQL/index.html>.\n",
    "\n",
    "And just like python (see [these notes](https://github.com/mhasoba/TheMulQuaBio/blob/master/silbiocomp/SilBioComp.pdf)), R can also be used to access, update and manage databases. In particular `SQLite` allows you to build, manipulate, and access databases easily. Try the script called `SQLinR.R` available in the `Code` directory of the master repo. It assumes that you are already familiar with the databases section of the python Chapter in [these notes](https://github.com/mhasoba/TheMulQuaBio/blob/master/silbiocomp/SilBioComp.pdf)."
