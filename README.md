*This will involve model challenge

All the teaching materials, including the lectures, jupter notebooks, code, and data are at [this git repository](https://github.com/vectorbite/VBiTraining).

## The Teaching Tools

We will be using `R`. The materials will be delivered through lectures and [Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org/). If you would like to use jupyter (not required for the workshop), have a look at this [Intro to Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/mhasoba/TheMulQuaBio/blob/master/notebooks/Intro.ipynb), or something else online.    

## How to prepare for the Workshop

 * We are assuming familarity with `R` basics. Here are some resources for brushing up (and there are many more online -- pick something that suits your learning style):
     - [Samraat's notes](https://github.com/mhasoba/TheMulQuaBio/blob/master/silbiocomp/SilBioComp.pdf) - The Intro to R Chapter, but more if you want
     - [try R](https://hangouts.google.com/_/elUi/chat-redirect?dest=http%3A%2F%2Ftryr.codeschool.com%2F)
     - https://ismayc.github.io/rbasics-book/
     - https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r/?tap_a=5644-dce66f&tap_s=10907-287229
     - https://kingaa.github.io/R_Tutorial/

A good bit of the traing will focus on data visualization. In particular, you might want to have a look at [ggplot](http://ggplot.yhathq.com/). There is a section on this in [Samraat's notes](https://github.com/mhasoba/TheMulQuaBio/blob/master/silbiocomp/SilBioComp.pdf), but plenty of other online resources are available.

  * Bring your laptop. Any operating system/platform will do.
  
  * Have R (version 3.2 or higher) installed.
  
  * Have some code editor installed. [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) is a great option, as it is a good code editor + a inuitive [GUI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface).
  
  * Inculcate the coding Jedi inside of you - or the Sith - whatever works.
